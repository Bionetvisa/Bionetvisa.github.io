</p>

<p><b>BioNetVisA</b> workshop brings together different actors of network biology from database providers, networks creators, computational biologists, biotech companies involved in data analysis and modeling to experimental biologists, clinicians that use systems biology approaches. The participants are exposed to the different paradigms of network biology and the latest achievements in the field.
</p>

### Motivation

<p>The goal of <b>BioNetVisA</b> workshop is to build a discussion around various approaches for biological knowledge formalisation, data integration and analysis; compatibility between different methods and biological networks resources available the field; applicability for concrete research and clinical projects depending on scientific question and type of high-throughput data.
</p>

<p>The <b>BioNetVisA</b> workshop aims at identifying bottlenecks and proposing short- and long-term objectives for the community as discussing questions about accessibility of available tools for wide range of user in every-day standalone application in biological and clinical labs. In addition, the possibilities for collective efforts by academic researchers, clinicians, biotech companies and future development directions in the field will be discussed during the round table panel.
</p>

### Topics
<p>Graphical representation of biological knowledge<br />
Pathway and network resources<br />
Networks annotation and curation<br />
Multi-omics data visualization and analysis in the context of networks<br />
Network modelling<br />
Basic research and clinical application of networks<br />
Microbiome and networks<br />
Networks for single-cell data interpretation<br />
Metabolomics and networks<br />
Networks applications for drug repositioning<br />
Networks in disease comorbidity studies<br />
</p>

### Scope
<p><b>Development, curation and maintenance of biological network resources</b><br />
Data models from interaction to pathway and network, available tools for the integration of new discoveries into existing signalling diagrams. Discussion of curation models from map manager-oriented to community-based update using web-tools and forums.
</p>

<p><b>Cell signalling knowledge representation paradigms</b><br />
From interaction to single pathways representation to comprehensive signalling networks: discussion of modes of biological processes representation; granularity, coverage, sources of information, annotation modes, cross-citations between different signalling networks resources, etc. Standard for graphical representation and data formats.
</p>

<p><b>Visualization of data through networks</b><br />
Paradigms of visualization of different types of high-throughput data on a network map. Data integration with a map. Methods compatibility with different paradigms of signalling networks reconstruction in various databases and resources.
</p>

<p><b>Analytical tools for network biology</b><br />
Tools for network analysis and manipulation, network modeling, network-based statistics. Studying network activation and inhibition, feedbacks and compensations, synthetic interactions.
</p>

<p><b>Applications of networks in multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research and in clinics</b><br />
Studies on single-cell data, microbiome, metabolomics and other omics data analysis, disease
comorbidity, drug response prediction using network-based approaches.
</p>

SUAVE LOMITO!

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# <font color="Red">Khe?</font>

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
