</p>

<p><b>BioNetVisA</b> workshop brings together different actors of network biology from database providers, networks creators, computational biologists, biotech companies involved in data analysis and modeling to experimental biologists, clinicians that use systems biology approaches. The participants are exposed to the different paradigms of network biology and the latest achievements in the field.
</p>

### Motivation

<p>The goal of <b>BioNetVisA</b> workshop is to build a discussion around various approaches for biological knowledge formalisation, data integration and analysis; compatibility between different methods and biological networks resources available the field; applicability for concrete research and clinical projects depending on scientific question and type of high-throughput data.
</p>

<p>The <b>BioNetVisA</b> workshop aims at identifying bottlenecks and proposing short- and long-term objectives for the community as discussing questions about accessibility of available tools for wide range of user in every-day standalone application in biological and clinical labs. In addition, the possibilities for collective efforts by academic researchers, clinicians, biotech companies and future development directions in the field will be discussed during the round table panel.

### Topics
<p>Graphical representation of biological knowledge<br />
Pathway and network resources<br />
Networks annotation and curation<br />
Multi-omics data visualization and analysis in the context of networks<br />

SUAVE LOMITO!

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# <font color="Red">Khe?</font>

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |
| ok           | good `oreos`      | hmm   |

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
